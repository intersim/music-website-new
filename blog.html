<h2>September 27, 2015</h2>
<p>
I spent the last two weeks of August in Chicago, where I took part in workshop for a new play directed by Gina Marie Hayes. It's called “Below: An Underworld Story” but it's not about a literal underworld; rather, it's a mental one. The whole thing is set in a care home for Alzheimer's patients, and the characters include a nurse, a caretaker, patients, and other mysterious figures.  It's a devised, immersive and site-specific piece of dance theatre. “Devised” meaning that for months, Gina and the cast improvised and then built the best bits into a narrative; “immersive” because the audience is not sitting down, they are free to wander through the space and follow whichever actor or storyline is most compelling to them (you can see that in the second half of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEJUCi2F1RY" alt="this trailer">this trailer</a>, which shows time-lapse footage of the audience moving around during the workshop performance); as for the “site-specific” part, this piece was designed to take place in the Women's Center of Evanston, IL, and the story is told through movement instead of dialogue.
  <br><br>
The rehearsal process was unlike anything I'd ever done before. Normally when working on a project with Gina, I read the script and then we talk about where music should go. However, this piece had no script; instead, we had a large grid of notecards pinned to the wall in the rehearsal room, with rows for a different space, columns,  for pieces of music. The grid was gradually filled in with the improvised pieces that the actors had been devising for months beforehand, with various narrative threads criss-crossing. There were already some pieces of music in place (a mixture of classical, indie rock, and electronica tracks), so my job was to fill in the gaps. I wrote some of the music by improvising while actors danced or read short stories, which was really fun.
  <br><br>
The recording process was absolutely hilarious; we had to build a makeshift recording fort over the piano out of a moving blanket, a music stand, and a mic stand. The sound quality turned out OK and was usable for our workshopping purposes, but someday we'll actually record these pieces in a studio.
