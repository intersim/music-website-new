# music-website-new

This page is an online portfolio for my work as a professional musician. It was important to include
information about my experience and education, as well as a section for prospective students since a great deal of
my living has come from my teaching work.

I'm currently only using vanilla HTML and CSS for this project; however, I have been playing around with Bootstrap and would love to build a future website using it.
