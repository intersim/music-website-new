# music-website-new

This page is an online portfolio for my work as a professional musician. It was important for me to also include a section for prospective students since a big part of my career has been teaching.

I'm currently only using vanilla HTML and CSS for this project; however, I have been playing around with Bootstrap and would love to build a future website using it.
